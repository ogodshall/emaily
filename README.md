# Emaily

## A sample app from Stephen Grider's React/Node course on Udemy

This app allows users to send out feedback surveys for their own projects.
But really it's just a demonstration... Planned features include:

* Logins (via Google OAuth, might add Facebook later)
* NoSQL backend database (MongoDB, via mLab)
* Payments (will be via Stripe)
* Front-end client build with React/Redux
* Material Design styling for the front-end care of Materialize CSS
